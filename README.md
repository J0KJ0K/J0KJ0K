# Hey, name's Jackie!
I'm a VTuber and computer engineering student!
Pronouns (he/him) don't really matter. Feel free to misgender me, just don't do that to other people!

I currently "work" on three YouTube channels:
 * I stream every Sunday on [Jackie JK || ENVTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@JackieJKENVtuber); most likely it will be some game. Relaxing before the week starts, you know?
 * [Jackie's Despair](https://www.youtube.com/@JackiesDespair), in which I nerd out about all things, FNaF
 * [JK Makes Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2tirw0P0uYxEr38j837Gnw), where I leave personal updates that will mean very little to you

You can also find me on Discord; my name there is jk0jk.

# About Minigame Investigator
I'm currently working on a rom hack of Pokemon Emerald based on Five Nights at Freddy's - Minigame Investigator.
If you're looking for spoilers, you can find the branch here: https://github.com/JK0JK/Minigame-Investigator/
Please don't tell anyone. The full, final experience will be much more fulfilling to both you and me than an unfinished, unpolished alpha version.
