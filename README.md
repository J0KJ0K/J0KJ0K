I currently "work" on three YouTube channels:
 * I stream every Sunday on [Jackie JK || ENVTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@JackieJKENVtuber); most likely it will be some game. Relaxing before the week starts, you know?
 * [Jackie's Despair](https://www.youtube.com/@JackiesDespair), in which I nerd out about all things, FNaF
 * [JK Makes Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2tirw0P0uYxEr38j837Gnw), where I leave personal updates that will mean very little to you

You can also find me on Discord; my name there is jk0jk.

# About Minigame Investigator
I used to work on a rom hack of Pokemon Emerald based on Five Nights at Freddy's - Minigame Investigator.
The project is currently abandoned, but I might come back to it eventually. I have not worked on it in AGES due to lack of experience with the GBA and to a mass scale merge conflict when updating to better tools. Also the FNaF lore has moved past being compatible with the storyline I had in mind, but that's just an excuse.
