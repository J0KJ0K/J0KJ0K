- 👋 Hi, I’m @J0KJ0K
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github
- 💞️ I’m working with a team called Elite Games to make a Pokemon Rom Hack based on Five Nights at Freddy's. It's going to be a remaking of the minigames
(therefore no battles and other pokemon-specific stuff is going to make the cut)
