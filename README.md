Hey, name's Jack but some folks call me Jackie.
I'm currently working on a rom hack of Pokemon Emerald based on Five Nights at Freddy's - Minigame Investigator.

If you're looking for spoilers, you can find the branch here: https://github.com/JK0JK/Minigame-Investigator/
Please don't tell anyone. The full, final experience will be much more fulfilling to both you and me than an unfinished, unpolished alpha version.

If you want to contact me, DM me on Discord: jk0jk
